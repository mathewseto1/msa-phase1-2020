Breaking bad web app that uses the breaking bad api.

My web app is hosted on https://breakingbadinfo.azurewebsites.net

The release pipeline shows all the breaking-bad characters from the television show, each character is displayed with a image and a info from the movie.

The build has the samething on the release pipeline but I have included a exandble and collapsble icon which I will probably add a quiz or a youtube link to scenes from the show.

The reason I choose to create this web app is to get more people into the breaking bad television show.

I have learn't to use Azure pipeline to deploy my website to a online page, so people can view the website.
